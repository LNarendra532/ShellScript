# Special variables in shell

we no need to define the variable, shell will provide to us
```
1. if you want all variables passed to script: $@
2. number of variables passed: $#
3. script name: $0
4. present working directory: $PWD
5. home directory of the user who is running the script: $HOME
6. which user is running the script: $USER
7. PID of the current script: $$
8. To chek previous status: $? we will get in numbers 1to 127 if status fails , if success 0 will get.
                           
9. sleep 10 &  - to run in backround
10. PID of the last command running in background: $!
```

## Logical operators
-----
```
1. gt --> greater than  
a. -gt --> not grater than
2. lt --> less than
a. -lt -- not less than
3. eq --> equal
4. ne --> not equal

#### Common Conditions
### File Conditions:
üìÅ Common File Test Operators
Test	Description
-e file	File exists (file or directory)
-f file	File exists and is a regular file (not a directory)
-d file	File exists and is a directory
-s file	File exists and is not empty
-r file	File is readable
-w file	File is writable
-x file	File is executable
-L file	File is a symbolic link
-b file	File is a block special file (e.g., hard disk)
-c file	File is a character special file (e.g., keyboard)

‚úÖ Examples
üî∏ Check if a file exists:

if [ -e "myfile.txt" ]; then
    echo "File exists."
else
    echo "File does not exist."
fi
üî∏ Check if a file is non-empty and readable:

if [ -s "log.txt" ] && [ -r "log.txt" ]; then
    echo "log.txt exists, is readable, and not empty."
fi
üî∏ Check if a directory exists:

if [ -d "/etc" ]; then
    echo "/etc is a directory."
fi

#### Integer Comparisons:
bash
Copy
Edit
if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]; then   # Equal
if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]; then   # Not equal
if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]; then   # Less than
if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]; then   # Less than or equal
if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]; then   # Greater than
if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]; then   # Greater than or equal
##### String Comparisons:

Edit
if [ "$a" = "$b" ]; then     # Strings are equal
if [ "$a" != "$b" ]; then    # Strings are not equal
if [ -z "$a" ]; then         # String is empty
if [ -n "$a" ]; then         # String is not empty

# Conditions
---------------
```
if(expression){
	this block runs if expression is true
}
else{
	this block runs if expression is false
}

if(raining){
	take umbrella
}
else{
	no need to take
}

raining false, ! false.. false*false = true
if(!raining){
	
}
else{
	
}

write a program if given number is less than 10 or not

if(number < 10){
	print number is less than 10
}
else{
	print number is not less than 10
}

```

install mysql
---------------
1. user is running with root access or not
2. if root user proceed to install
3. else show the error that please run with root access
denf install mysql -y

exit status code
---------------
0-127
```
 1. success --> 0 
 2. other than 0 --> failure
```
Functions
---------------
a machine is functioning --> doing something

coffee maker
inputs: coffee beans, milk, water
output: coffee

function takes input and do some work, you can call whenever you require

function coffeeMaker(milk, coffee beans, water){
	boilwater
	crushbeans
	mix milk, water and powder
	return coffee
}

coffeeMaker(milk, coffee beans, water)

repeated code you can keep it in function and call whenever you require

mysql nginx python3

### you can provide args to function just like you do to the script
```
sh install-command.sh mysql python3 nginx 
```
